# BANK-APP-fullstack
MERN stack project (School assignment)
I used ReactJS, Redux, Node JS. Mongo DB, Mongoose and some other technologies to build this app which is a simple banking app.
In this app it is possible to register a new user and the user can login and start making accounts and have access to them, deposit and withdraw money.
